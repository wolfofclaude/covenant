export const FAQS: FAQ[] = [
  {
    question: 'Do I need a will if I live in the UAE?',
    answer:
      "Yes. Without a registered UAE will, your estate may be distributed under UAE personal status law, which can differ significantly from your home country's rules. This is especially important for expats with children, property, or bank accounts in the UAE.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does it take to create my will?',
    answer:
      'The online questionnaire takes 10–15 minutes. We then prepare your documents within 1–2 business days. Court registration typically takes a further 1–3 weeks depending on the emirate and court.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does a UAE will cost with Covenant?',
    answer:
      'Our fee starts at AED 799 for a single UAE will. Mirror wills for couples cost AED 1,199. Court fees (AED 950 per will, AED 1,900 for mirrors) are payable separately to the UAE courts — we never mark these up.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Which courts can register my will?',
    answer:
      'We work with the ADJD (Abu Dhabi Judicial Department), the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) Wills Service, and ADGM (Abu Dhabi Global Market). We recommend the best option for your situation during our review.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I include assets from my home country?',
    answer:
      'Yes. We offer home-country wills for assets held in the UK and India (with more countries coming soon). A cross-border estate plan ensures your assets everywhere are protected without conflicts between jurisdictions.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if I die without a will in the UAE?',
    answer:
      'Without a registered will, UAE courts may apply Sharia law to distribute your UAE-based estate, regardless of your nationality or religion. This can mean your assets do not pass to the people you intended, and guardianship of children may be uncertain.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I update my will after it is registered?',
    answer:
      'Yes. You can update or revoke your will at any time. We send annual reminders so your will stays current with your life circumstances. Updates are straightforward and typically cost less than the original registration.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is my personal information secure?',
    answer:
      'Absolutely. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest. Your documents are stored in our secure Vault and only accessible by you and the people you designate. We never share your information with third parties.',
  },
